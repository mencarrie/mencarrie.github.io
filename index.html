		<h1>The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock</h1>
		<h2>Section 7</h2>
		<p>I should have been a pair of ragged claws<br>Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.</p>
		<p>And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!<br>Smoothed by long fingers,<br>Asleep ... tired ... or it malingers,<br>Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.<br>Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,<br>Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?<br>But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,<br>Though I have seen my head (grown slightly bald) brought in upon a platter,<br>I am no prophet&mdash;and here's no great matter;<br>I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,<br>And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,<br>And in short, I was afraid.</p>
